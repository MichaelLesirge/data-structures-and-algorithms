Random projects that are in some way related to learning data structures and algorithm or just for fun. I decided to just put them here

These GIFs have a lower framerate then the actual projects, so

## Sorting
Implemented bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. I also made a visualizer to view the time complexity of each algorithm.

Sorting 20 element long lists. The GIF is a little choppy so I suggest you run this one for yourself.

Quick and Merge on 100 element long lists

## Maze Generation and Solver
Simple maze generator using a recursive backtracking algorithm and maze solver the A star (A*) pathfinding / graph traversal algorithm.

Pathfinder though auto generated "perfect" maze

# Binary Tree
Binary search tree visualizer. Currently pretty simple but I wanted to put it here since it fits.

Adding Nodes to Binary Search Tree
