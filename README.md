Random projects that are in some way related to learning data structures and algorithms or just for fun. Mostly just python Pygame visualizations of random things I thought were cool.

## Sorting
Implemented bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Made a visualizer so you can watch them sort, along with adding some sound effects to the sorting animation.

Sorting 20 element long lists. The GIF is a little choppy so I suggest you run this one for yourself.

Quick and Merge on 100 element long lists

## Maze Generation and Solver
Simple maze generator using a recursive backtracking algorithm and maze solver the A star (A*) pathfinding / graph traversal algorithm. You can draw or auto generate mazes that it will solve.

Pathfinder though auto generated "perfect" maze

# Binary Tree
Binary search tree visualizer. You can add nodes and see where they are added, as well as having the tree balence itself.

# Conway's Game of Life
Simple conway's game of life. Lets you turn on cells and let it run.
