Random projects that are in some way related to learning data structures and algorithm or just for fun. I decided to just put them here

These are mostly all single file projects so you could copy and paste them into [here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/) for quick running on the browser.

Also check out my [leetcode](https://github.com/michael-lesirge/leetcode) repo.

## Sorting
Implemented bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. I also made a visulizer for the time taken for each and for the time it takes them to sort. I originally made this during my [intermediate programming class](https://github.com/michael-lesirge/intermediate-programming-class) to make the sorting unit more interesting.

Sorting 20 element long lists. The GIF is a little choppy so I suggest you run this one for yourself.
